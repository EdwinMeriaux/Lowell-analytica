Task was to create a system to vote in a fake virtual election.

Script launches an incognito mode chrome page to allow for multiple voting. The voting system recognizes the same chrome page but not different incognito mode pages.

Voting wait takes random amount of time (random time pause) to mimic real users and not a bot.
